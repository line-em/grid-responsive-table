#About

Just a simple snippet of a responsive table made with **css grid**. A reference and starting point for future projects, as it is lightly styled and doesn't have any interactivity. Focused mostly on responsiveness.

The table code is found at **table.css**, and applied at **Table.jsx** and **TableHeader.jsx**.

The other components in this project are purely presentational.
